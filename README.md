## Profile
"Hello! My name is Nathan. I am an indie game developer and proud hobbyist living in the eastern United States. I started the Prismatic Interactive project in October of 2022, formally known as Parallax Interactive or FlyDog Games. Since then, I have assembled a team of exceptional and talented developers from around the world. I have wanted to make video games since I was a kid and dreamed of what my games would be if I ever decided to enter that field. So, as a determined high schooler, I decided to start the project. I am so happy I did, as success is already showing. I can't wait to see where this project goes, and I can ensure that this project will never fall out!"
