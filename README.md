## Profile
"Hello! My name is Nathan. I am an indie game developer and proud hobbyist living in the eastern United States. I started the Parallax Interactive project in October of 2022, formally known as FlyDog Games. Since then, I have acquired a team of amazing and talented developers from all over the world. I have wanted to make video games since I was a kid and dreamed of what my games would be if I ever decided to enter that field. So as a determined high schooler, I decided to start the project. I am so happy I did as success is already showing. I can't wait to see where this project goes, and I can ensure that this project will never fall out!"
